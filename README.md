# Webbf
## Description

Webbf is tool designed as a [Patator](https://github.com/lanjelot/patator) wrapper to find weak and default accounts on web administration interfaces.
Webbf takes as input a JSON file (output generated by [Paparazzi](https://github.com/bik3te/Paparazzi)). Every URL specified on this file must be as the following format : protocol://ip_or_hostname:port

## Modules

Each module corresponds to a type of web administration interface. Currently, 6 web interfaces are handled by the Webbf :

* Tomcat
* Jenkins
* Splunk
* Jira
* Grafana
* BMC Discovery

These modules are classes with the following format :

```python
class {web_solution_name}Module():
	def __init__(self, lst, nb_threads):
		...
	def tryDefaultCredsPatator(self, url):
		...
```

These classes are dynamically instanciated with the following parameters :

* lst : corresponds to a list of urls associated hosting the targeted service
* nb_threads : number of threads

## Acknowledgments

This repository contains the great lanjelot's [Patator](https://github.com/lanjelot/patator) as submodule.
